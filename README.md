While I was living in Seoul, South Korea I saw that brunch, breakfast, and bakery culture is only just now being adopted by Korean culture, so foreigners tend to rely on word-of-mouth recommendations to find the few hidden gems around the country. I wanted to create a solution to this, so I decided to build Brunchy!

Brunchy is a responsive, fullstack, MERN web application where users can can create an account, manage their own profile, and create, view, and share photos and information about their favorite brunch, breakfast, and bakery spots around their city. Currently, Brunchy is based in South Korea, though I look forward to expanding our boundaries in the future!
