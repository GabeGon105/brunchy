While I was living in Seoul, South Korea I saw that brunch, breakfast, and bakery culture is only just now being adopted by Korean culture, so foreigners tend to rely on word-of-mouth recommendations to find the few hidden gems around the country. I wanted to create a solution to this, so I decided to build Brunchy!

Brunchy is a responsive, fullstack, MERN web application where users can can create an account, manage their own profile, and create, view, and share photos and information about their favorite brunch, breakfast, and bakery spots around their city. Currently, Brunchy is based in South Korea, though I look forward to expanding our boundaries in the future!

## Optimizations

Throughout the development process, I prioritized writing clean, efficient code to ensure optimal performance, though due to time constraints there are some optimizations that can still be made in the future. For example:

-Optimize algorithms for tasks like sorting and filtering posts. This approach could help Brunchy deliver a smoother user experience, even as the user base grows.

-To improve response times and reduce the load on the server, an improved caching mechanism could be implemented in Brunchy. By caching frequently accessed data, such as user profiles and popular posts, the need for repetitive database queries could be reduced. This optimization could enhance the overall speed and responsiveness of the application.

Overall, Iâ€™m very happy with where the application is at now, and I look forward to improving upon it moving forward!

## Lessons Learned:

I worked on this project during my nights and weekends over the course of a few months, putting in countless hours of work. Over the course of this project, I learned important takeaways, such as:

Donâ€™t be afraid to start over. When I first started this project, I built up a solid base for Brunchy using EJS (ðŸ˜¬) as my front-end templating language and Bootstrap for my styes. After many hours into the project, I began to feel constrained using EJS and felt as though my code wasnâ€™t looking so clean. On top of this, I couldnâ€™t stand the signature Bootstrap styles. So, after much internal-debate, I decided to scrap it and start over! From that point forward I chose to run with React.js and TailwindCSS. While it did take many hours to catch up to where I was before, I no longer felt constrained by EJS or uninspired by Bootstrap, and I was able to really break into a stride up to the completion of Brunchy!

Another important lesson I learned is just how important teamwork is on a project of this scale. I built this project by myself, yes, but at every step of the process I reached out to my community of developers and engineers to ask for opinions and advice. My works in the past have always been rooted in team work, but building Brunchy showed how a strong team effort is vital to success. A team of eyes can always spot more than just one pair can, and a group of problem-solvers working together can lead to truly great ideas. :)
